Mastering is the final stage in the production process and ensures that the music fits together seamlessly and that it is presented with the best possible sound. It involves editing and compiling the required mixes and tracks in production order, cleaning the audio to remove any unwanted blemishes or corruptions, polishing the mixed sound with equalisation, compression and other outboard processing and then producing the final master. 

The combination of our award-winning engineers and our unrivaled range of traditional and state-of-the-art equipment ensure that we are world leaders in the fields of audio mastering and sound restoration.
